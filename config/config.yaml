# following keywords are used to narrow the parsing. Each practitionner does not have the same availability for all their
# visiting motives, so adding keywords will make the reminders more precise as you won't be reminded for unwanted visiting motives.
# the reminding will be done for the visiting motives that have the most matching keywords. If there are equalities, they will all be parsed
visiting_motive_keywords:
  - premi√®re
  - consultation

# if any of the following keywords is present in a visiting_motive, this motive will not be parsed for vailability.
visiting_motive_forbidden_keywords:
  - suivi
  - chirurgie
  - vaccin

# set a max date for reminder. Format YYYY-MM-DD.
# Any practitioner availability after this date will be ignored. If you set to empty or to a date previous to today, it'll be ignored
